Setting Up Private Repository
Create a new private repo on GitHub/GitLab

bash
git init
git remote add origin [your-repo-url]
git branch -M main
Add proper .gitignore

bash
# Python
__pycache__/
*.py[cod]
*.so
.Python
env/

# Data files
*.json
*.db
*.sqlite

# IDE
.vscode/
.idea/
Initial commit with structure

bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project structure"
git push -u origin main
Next Steps
Implement version control workflow (feature branches)

Set up CI/CD pipeline (testing/linting)

Add issue templates for bugs/features

Create documentation website (GitHub Pages/MkDocs)

Develop testing strategy (unit/integration tests)
